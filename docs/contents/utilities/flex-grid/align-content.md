### Align Content
The `align-content` property aligns a flex container's lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how `justify-content` aligns individual items within the main-axis.

<table-utility prefix="content" property="justify-align-content" attribute="align-content" class="mb-lg"></table-utility>

### Justify Content
The `justify-content` property aligns flex items along the main axis of the current line of the flex container. It helps distribute extra free space left over when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.

<table-utility prefix="justify" property="justify-align-content" attribute="justify-content"></table-utility>
