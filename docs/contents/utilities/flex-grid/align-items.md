### Align Items
The `align-items` property aligns flex items along the cross axis of the current line of the flex container. It helps distribute extra free space left over when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.

### Justify Items
The `justify-items` property aligns grid items along the inline (row) axis of their grid area. It helps distribute extra free space left over when either all the grid items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.
